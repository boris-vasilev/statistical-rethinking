# 8.2 Symmetry of interactions

Interactions can be interpreted in two symmetrical ways. In the example with ruggedness and GDP:

-   How much does the association between ruggedness and log GDP depend upon whether the nation is in Africa?

-   How much does the association of Africa with log GDP depend upon ruggedness?

From the point of view of the model, those two are equivalent.

**TODO: READ CHAPTER AGAIN. UNCLEAR.**
